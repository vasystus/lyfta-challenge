✔️Break up every part of the video player into a separate user story.

# 🏹My Focus:

I was quite excited about this task so completed the entire video player.

The user will be able to play, pause and stop the video and also can control the volume of the video.


**The chosen video :**
I chose to introduce people of the world to one of the oldest and most beatiful cities in Ukraine - **__Lviv__**, in case it will be destroyed by the Russians during the current war in Ukraine.
